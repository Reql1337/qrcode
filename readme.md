# Docker and Python

For this assignment you will be combining Docker with Python to create a program that generates a QR code PNG file that
contains a URL. The QR code can be viewed with the camera on your phone to allow a user to click on it and send them to
the target website. You must make your program generate a QR code that takes someone to your GitHub homepage i.e. https://github.com/kaw393939 <replace mine with yours>
